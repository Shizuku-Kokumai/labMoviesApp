# Web App Dev 2 - Assignment 1 - ReactJS app.

Name: Shizuku Kokumai

## Overview.
I added "POPULAR", "TOP RELATED", and "UPCOMING" in the site header. In POPULAR, it shows the a list of the current popular movies on TMDB, and this list updates daily. In TOP RELATED, it shows a list of the top related movies on TMDB. In "UP COMING", it shows a list of upcoming movies in theatres. And I changed the valuatoin color based on how well they're rated. If it is less than 7, the color is blue. If it is greater than 7, the color is red.

### New Pages.
